# Malware & leakage information
"Mobile malware is malicious software that targets mobile phones or wireless-enabled Personal digital assistants (PDA), by causing the collapse of the system and loss or leakage of confidential information. As wireless phones and PDA networks have become more and more common and have grown in complexity, it has become increasingly difficult to ensure their safety and security against electronic attacks in the form of viruses or other malware."

# Content
Dataset consisting of feature vectors of 215 attributes extracted from 15,036 applications (5,560 malware apps from Drebin project and 9,476 benign apps). The dataset has been used to develop and evaluate multilevel classifier fusion approach for Android malware detection, published in the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics paper 'DroidFusion: A Novel Multilevel Classifier Fusion Approach for Android Malware Detection. The supporting file contains the description of the feature vectors/attributes obtained via static code analysis of the Android apps.
